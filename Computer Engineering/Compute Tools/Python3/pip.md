## pip install -e

The command `pip install -e .` is used to install a Python package in "editable" mode. This means that the package is installed in a way that allows you to make changes to the code and immediately see the effects in your Python environment, without the need to reinstall the package.

The `.` at the end of the command represents the current directory, and the `-e` flag indicates that the package should be installed in editable mode.

When you run this command, pip will look for a `setup.py` file in the current directory, which is usually the root directory of the package you want to install. The `setup.py` file contains information about the package, such as its name, version, dependencies, and more.

By installing a package in editable mode, you can make changes to the code, such as adding new features or fixing bugs, and immediately see the effects in your Python environment without having to reinstall the package. This can be useful during the development of a package or when testing changes to an existing package.

Note that when you install a package in editable mode, the package is not copied to the site-packages directory of your Python distribution like a regular installation. Instead, a link is created that points to the package's source code in the current directory. This means that any changes you make to the code will be reflected immediately in your Python environment. However, it also means that if you delete or move the package's source code, the link will be broken and the package will no longer be available in your Python environment.
