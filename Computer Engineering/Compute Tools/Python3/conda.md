To configure proxy settings for Conda, you can follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal and execute the following command to create a Conda configuration file if it doesn't already exist:
```
$ touch ~/.condarc
```

2. Open the file in a text editor:
```
$ nano ~/.condarc
```

3. Add the following lines to the file, replacing `proxy_server` and `proxy_port` with your proxy server's hostname and port number:
```
proxy_servers:
    http: http://proxy_server:proxy_port
    https: https://proxy_server:proxy_port
```

4. If your proxy server requires authentication, add the following lines with your username and password:
```
proxy_servers:
    http: http://username:password@proxy_server:proxy_port
    https: https://username:password@proxy_server:proxy_port
```

5. Save and close the file.

6. Test your configuration by running a simple Conda command, like this:
```
$ conda search pandas
```

If the command executes successfully and downloads the package index from the remote server, your proxy configuration is working correctly.

Note that some organizations may use self-signed SSL certificates for their proxy servers, which can cause SSL verification failures in Conda. To disable SSL verification, you can add the following line to your Conda configuration file, below the `proxy_servers` section:
```
ssl_verify: false
```
However, this is not recommended as it can expose you to security risks. Instead, you should try to obtain and install the root CA certificate for your proxy server.
