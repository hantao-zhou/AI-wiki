| Analytic Geometry of Space                           | Analytic Geometry of Space is a fundamental course for students in mathematics major. It is the subject studying space geometric graphics by algebraic method, the bridge of elementary mathematics to advanced mathematics, the cornerstone of advanced Mathematics. In rectangular coordinate system in space, we study the properties of geometric figures such as planes, space lines, cylinders, cones, surfaces of revolution by algebraic method. So as to cultivate the students' abstract thinking ability and correctly handle the contradiction between the number and the form. Through the calculation of the mathematical formula, we can understand the nature of the graph and the relationship between the graphics.
So the abstract spatial imagination ability and the logic reasoning ability can be developed. 
The main contents include: Rectangular coordinate system, Scalar product, Vector product, Triple scalar product, Planes and lines in space, Cylinders, Cones, Surfaces of revolution, Ruled quadric surfaces, Invariants and standard type for quadric curves and quadric surfaces.
