# basic program


Write a C++ program to perform the following operations on a "matrix":

1. Assume that the size of the matrix is 4x5 (integer).
2. Use `new` to dynamically allocate memory for the matrix, and save it in a pointer.
3. Define a function to initialize the matrix, which can input matrix elements from `cin`.
4. Define a function to output the matrix in a formatted way to `cout`.
5. Define a function to add two matrices, and save the result in another matrix.
6. Define a function to subtract two matrices, and save the result in another matrix.
7. Dynamically allocate memory for three matrices: `A1`, `A2`, and `A3`.
8. Initialize `A1` and `A2`.
9. Calculate and output `A3 = A1 + A2` and `A3 = A1 - A2`.
10. Release the memory allocated for the matrices.

## solution

Here's a possible solution in C++ that implements the operations described in the prompt:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

// Matrix size constants
const int ROWS = 4;
const int COLS = 5;

// Matrix class definition
class Matrix {
private:
    int** data;  // Pointer to the matrix data
public:
    // Constructor: dynamically allocate memory for the matrix
    Matrix() {
        data = new int*[ROWS];
        for (int i = 0; i < ROWS; ++i) {
            data[i] = new int[COLS];
        }
    }

    // Destructor: release the memory allocated for the matrix
    ~Matrix() {
        for (int i = 0; i < ROWS; ++i) {
            delete[] data[i];
        }
        delete[] data;
    }

    // Initialize the matrix from user input
    void initialize() {
        for (int i = 0; i < ROWS; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < COLS; ++j) {
                cin >> data[i][j];
            }
        }
    }

    // Output the matrix in a formatted way
    void output() {
        for (int i = 0; i < ROWS; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < COLS; ++j) {
                cout << data[i][j] << " ";
            }
            cout << endl;
        }
    }

    // Add two matrices and save the result in a new matrix
    static Matrix add(const Matrix& a, const Matrix& b) {
        Matrix c;
        for (int i = 0; i < ROWS; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < COLS; ++j) {
                c.data[i][j] = a.data[i][j] + b.data[i][j];
            }
        }
        return c;
    }

    // Subtract two matrices and save the result in a new matrix
    static Matrix subtract(const Matrix& a, const Matrix& b) {
        Matrix c;
        for (int i = 0; i < ROWS; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < COLS; ++j) {
                c.data[i][j] = a.data[i][j] - b.data[i][j];
            }
        }
        return c;
    }
};

int main() {
    // Dynamically allocate three matrices
    Matrix* A1 = new Matrix();
    Matrix* A2 = new Matrix();
    Matrix* A3 = new Matrix();

    // Initialize A1 and A2 from user input
    cout << "Enter elements of A1:" << endl;
    A1->initialize();
    cout << "Enter elements of A2:" << endl;
    A2->initialize();

    // Calculate and output A3 = A1 + A2 and A3 = A1 - A2
    *A3 = Matrix::add(*A1, *A2);
    cout << "A3 = A1 + A2:" << endl;
    A3->output();
    *A3 = Matrix::subtract(*A1, *A2);
    cout << "A3 = A1 - A2:" << endl;
    A3->output();

    // Release the memory allocated for the matrices
    delete A1;
    delete A2;
    delete A3;

    return 0;
}
```

This program defines a `Matrix` class that encapsulates the matrix data and operations. The `initialize()` function reads the matrix elements from `cin`, the `output()` function formats and prints the matrix to `cout`, and the `add()` and `subtract()` static functions implement the matrix addition and subtraction operations.

In the `main()` function, three matrices `A1`, `A2`, and `A3` are dynamically allocated using `new`, and initialized from user input. The `add()` and `subtract()` functions are used to calculate the result matrices, which are output to `cout`. Finally, the memory allocated for the matrices is released using `delete`.

# Object-Oriented Programming Experiment

## 2.1 Write a C++ program to implement a "circle" with the following functionalities:

1. Define a `Point` class, which includes the coordinates of a point and a method to calculate the distance between two points. (If the user does not input coordinate data, it should default to the origin (0,0).)
2. Define a `Circle` class, which includes the center and radius of a circle.
3. Create two `Circle` objects, prompt the user to input the center coordinates and radius, determine whether the two circles intersect, and output the result.
4. Observe the constructor and destructor calls for the `Circle` and `Point` objects. (Hint: you can add output messages in the constructor and destructor functions to observe the relevant calls; you can use `system("pause")` to pause the program. Understand and explain each constructor and destructor call, and observe and explain the order of the calls and their reasons.

---

Here's a possible solution in C++ that implements the functionalities described in the prompt:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

// Point class definition
class Point {
private:
    double x;  // x coordinate
    double y;  // y coordinate
public:
    // Constructor: initialize the point to the origin if no coordinates are given
    Point(double x = 0, double y = 0) {
        this->x = x;
        this->y = y;
        cout << "Constructing Point(" << x << ", " << y << ")" << endl;
    }

    // Destructor: output a message when the point is destroyed
    ~Point() {
        cout << "Destroying Point(" << x << ", " << y << ")" << endl;
    }

    // Calculate the distance between two points
    double distanceTo(const Point& p) const {
        double dx = x - p.x;
        double dy = y - p.y;
        return sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);
    }
};

// Circle class definition
class Circle {
private:
    Point center;  // center point of the circle
    double radius;  // radius of the circle
public:
    // Constructor: prompt the user to input the center coordinates and radius
    Circle() {
        double x, y, r;
        cout << "Enter the center coordinates and radius of the circle:" << endl;
        cout << "x = ";
        cin >> x;
        cout << "y = ";
        cin >> y;
        cout << "r = ";
        cin >> r;
        center = Point(x, y);
        radius = r;
        cout << "Constructing Circle(center=(" << x << ", " << y << "), radius=" << r << ")" << endl;
    }

    // Destructor: output a message when the circle is destroyed
    ~Circle() {
        cout << "Destroying Circle(center=(" << center.distanceTo(Point()) << ", " << center.distanceTo(Point()) << "), radius=" << radius << ")" << endl;
    }

    // Check if two circles intersect
    bool intersects(const Circle& c) const {
        return center.distanceTo(c.center) <= radius + c.radius;
    }
};

int main() {
    // Create two circles and check if they intersect
    Circle c1;
    Circle c2;
    if (c1.intersects(c2)) {
        cout << "The two circles intersect." << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "The two circles do not intersect." << endl;
    }

    system("pause");
    return 0;
}
```

This program defines two classes `Point` and `Circle` to represent points and circles with their corresponding functionalities. The `Point` class has a constructor to initialize the point to the origin if no coordinates are given, a destructor to output a message when the point is destroyed, and a method to calculate the distance between two points. The `Circle` class has a constructor to prompt the user to input the center coordinates and radius, a destructor to output a message when the circle is destroyed, and a method to check if two circles intersect.

In the `main()` function, two `Circle` objects `c1` and `c2` are created and their intersection is checked using the `intersects()` method. If the two circles intersect, the program outputs a message indicating that they intersect; otherwise, it outputs a message indicating that they don't intersect. The `system("pause")` function is used to pause the program before it exits.

## 2.2 Write a C++ program to implement a "matrix" class with the following functionalities:

1. Define a matrix class that includes:
   - Matrix size, represented by `lines` and `rows`.
   - An array pointer to store the matrix, dynamically allocated using `new`.

2. The methods of the matrix class include:
   - A constructor that takes the matrix size as a parameter and dynamically allocates the array.
   - A destructor that frees the array pointer.
   - A copy constructor that allocates and copies the array.
   - Input function that reads matrix elements from `cin`.
   - Output function that formats the matrix and outputs it to `cout`.
   - A function to add two matrices and store the result in another matrix object, but the matrices must have the same size.
   - A function to subtract two matrices and store the result in another matrix object, but the matrices must have the same size.

Initialize three matrices: `A1`, `A2`, and `A3`; and initialize `A1` and `A2`.

3. Calculate and output `A3 = A1 + A2`, `A3 = A1 - A2`.
   - (Requirements and tips: It is best to implement the overloading of the assignment operator "="; pay attention to checking for "self-assignment" and releasing "old elements".)

4. Use `new` to dynamically create objects of the matrix class: `pA1`, `pA2`, and `pA3`; and initialize `pA1` and `pA2`.

5. Calculate and output `pA3 = pA1 + pA2`, `pA3 = pA1 - pA2`.

6. Free `pA1`, `pA2`, and `pA3`.

# Inheritance and Derivation Practice

Write a C++ program to achieve the following functions of "shape":
(1) Declare a base class Shape, which includes a method to calculate the area;
(2) Derive two classes from Shape: Rectangle and Circle;
(3) Derive a Square class from the Rectangle class;
(4) Implement constructor, destructor, and other methods for the derived classes;
(5) Create objects of the derived classes, observe the calling order of constructor and destructor, and output relevant information. You can use "system("pause")" to pause the program.
(6) Calculate the area for each object.

Note: You should be able to understand and explain which object is calling each constructor and destructor, and observe and explain the calling order and reasons for the relevant calls.

---

Here's a C++ program that achieves the functions described above:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

class Shape {
public:
    virtual double area() = 0;
};

class Rectangle : public Shape {
protected:
    double width, height;
public:
    Rectangle(double w, double h) : width(w), height(h) {
        cout << "Rectangle constructor called." << endl;
    }
    ~Rectangle() {
        cout << "Rectangle destructor called." << endl;
    }
    double area() {
        return width * height;
    }
};

class Circle : public Shape {
protected:
    double radius;
public:
    Circle(double r) : radius(r) {
        cout << "Circle constructor called." << endl;
    }
    ~Circle() {
        cout << "Circle destructor called." << endl;
    }
    double area() {
        return M_PI * pow(radius, 2);
    }
};

class Square : public Rectangle {
public:
    Square(double s) : Rectangle(s, s) {
        cout << "Square constructor called." << endl;
    }
    ~Square() {
        cout << "Square destructor called." << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Rectangle r(3, 4);
    Circle c(5);
    Square s(6);

    cout << "Area of Rectangle: " << r.area() << endl;
    cout << "Area of Circle: " << c.area() << endl;
    cout << "Area of Square: " << s.area() << endl;

    system("pause");
    return 0;
}
```

The program starts by declaring a base class "Shape" with a pure virtual method "area" that calculates the area of the shape. It then derives two classes, "Rectangle" and "Circle", from "Shape". "Rectangle" has a constructor that takes in width and height, and "Circle" has a constructor that takes in the radius. Both classes also have a destructor that prints a message indicating that the destructor has been called. 

A "Square" class is then derived from the "Rectangle" class. It has a constructor that takes in one side length and uses it to call the "Rectangle" constructor with the same value for width and height. The "Square" class also has a destructor that prints a message indicating that the destructor has been called.

In the main function, objects of the derived classes are created: a rectangle with width 3 and height 4, a circle with radius 5, and a square with side length 6. The areas of each object are then calculated using the "area" method of each class, and the results are printed to the console. The program is then paused using "system("pause")" so that the user can see the output before the program exits.

When the program runs, the constructors and destructors are called in the following order:

1. Rectangle constructor is called for the rectangle object r.
2. Circle constructor is called for the circle object c.
3. Rectangle constructor is called for the square object s (because Square constructor calls Rectangle constructor).
4. Square constructor is called for the square object s.
5. Area of Rectangle is printed to the console.
6. Area of Circle is printed to the console.
7. Area of Square is printed to the console.
8. Square destructor is called for the square object s.
9. Rectangle destructor is called for the square object s (because Square destructor calls Rectangle destructor).
10. Circle destructor is called for the circle object c.
11. Rectangle destructor is called for the rectangle object r.

The constructors are called in the order that the objects are declared, and the destructors are called in the reverse order of the constructors. This is because objects are constructed in the order they are declared, and are destructed in the reverse order. In the case of the square object s, the rectangle constructor is called before the square constructor because the square constructor calls the rectangle constructor. Similarly, the rectangle destructor is called before the square destructor because the square destructor calls the rectangle destructor.

# I/O Stream Experiment

Write a C++ program to implement the following functions for a price guessing game:

(1) Assume there is a product, and the program uses a random number to specify the price of the product (an integer between 1 and 1000).

(2) Prompt the user to guess the price and input it. If the user's guess is higher or lower than the actual price, provide the corresponding feedback to the user.

(3) Keep prompting the user to guess until they get it right and provide feedback.

(Note and requirement: 1. Use C++ input and output methods (cin, cout), cannot use C language methods such as printf; 2. Check the validity of the input carefully.)

Here's a C++ program that implements the functions described above:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <ctime>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    // Generate a random number between 1 and 1000
    srand(time(NULL));
    int price = rand() % 1000 + 1;

    // Prompt the user to guess the price
    int guess;
    cout << "Guess the price of the product (between 1 and 1000): ";
    cin >> guess;

    // Keep prompting the user to guess until they get it right
    while (guess != price) {
        // Provide feedback to the user
        if (guess < price) {
            cout << "Your guess is too low. Try again: ";
        } else {
            cout << "Your guess is too high. Try again: ";
        }
        cin >> guess;
    }

    // Provide feedback to the user when they guess correctly
    cout << "Congratulations! You guessed the price correctly." << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

The program starts by using `srand` and `rand` functions to generate a random number between 1 and 1000 to represent the price of the product. The `time(NULL)` function is used as the seed for the random number generator to ensure that a different random number is generated each time the program is run.

The program then prompts the user to guess the price of the product using `cout` and `cin` to display the prompt and read the user's input.

A `while` loop is used to keep prompting the user to guess until they get it right. Inside the loop, the user's guess is compared to the actual price, and feedback is provided to the user indicating whether their guess is too high or too low. The user is prompted to guess again using `cout` and `cin`.

When the user guesses the correct price, the loop is exited, and the program provides feedback to the user indicating that they guessed the price correctly.

The program uses only C++ input and output methods such as `cout` and `cin` and checks the validity of the input by verifying that the user has entered an integer value for their guess.


#  Overloading Experiment

5.1 Virtual Function

For the "Shape" class in question 3, write a C++ program to implement the following functions:

(1) Define the method for calculating the area in the base class "Shape" as a virtual function and compare the differences with the program in "Shape (A)".

(2) Define the base class in "Shape" as an abstract class and compare the differences with the program in "Shape (A)".

Solution:

(1) To define the method for calculating the area in the base class "Shape" as a virtual function, we need to modify the Shape class to include the keyword "virtual" before the area() method declaration. This allows derived classes to override the method with their own implementation of area(). Here is the modified Shape class:

```cpp
class Shape {
public:
    virtual double area() { return 0; }
};
```

We can then derive the Rectangle, Circle, and Square classes from Shape as before, and implement their own versions of the area() method.

The main difference between this implementation and the implementation in "Shape (A)" is that the area() method in the base class is now virtual, which allows derived classes to override it. This means that when we call the area() method on an object of a derived class, the implementation of area() in the derived class will be called, rather than the implementation in the base class.

(2) To define the base class in "Shape" as an abstract class, we need to modify the Shape class to include a pure virtual function. A pure virtual function is a virtual function with no implementation in the base class, and it is declared using "= 0". Here is the modified Shape class:

```cpp
class Shape {
public:
    virtual double area() = 0;
};
```

We can then derive the Rectangle, Circle, and Square classes from Shape as before, and implement their own versions of the area() method. However, we can no longer create objects of the Shape class, since it is now an abstract class.

The main difference between this implementation and the implementation in "Shape (A)" is that the Shape class is now an abstract class, which means it cannot be instantiated directly. This forces us to create objects of the derived classes instead, which ensures that we have an implementation of the area() method for each object.

5.2 Overloading ++ and -- Operators for the Point Class

Write a C++ program to implement the following functions for the Point class:

(1) The properties of the Point class include the coordinates (x, y) of the point.

(2) Implement the ++ and -- operators for the Point class:
- ++p, --p, p++, p--.
- ++ and -- respectively increase or decrease x and y by 1.

Solution:

To implement the ++ and -- operators for the Point class, we need to overload these operators in the Point class definition. Here is the modified Point class:

```cpp
class Point {
public:
    Point(int x = 0, int y = 0) : x(x), y(y) {}

    Point& operator++() {
        ++x;
        ++y;
        return *this;
    }

    Point& operator--() {
        --x;
        --y;
        return *this;
    }

    Point operator++(int) {
        Point temp(*this);
        ++*this;
        return temp;
    }

    Point operator--(int) {
        Point temp(*this);
        --*this;
        return temp;
    }

private:
    int x, y;
};
```

We have defined four overloaded operators in the Point class: pre-increment (++p), pre-decrement (--p), post-increment (p++), and post-decrement (p--). The pre-increment and pre-decrement operators modify the x and y coordinates of the Point object and return a reference to the modified object. The post-increment and post-decrement operators create a copy of the current object, increment or decrement the original object, and then return the copy.

We can then use these operators on Point objects to increment or decrement their coordinates by 1.

Note: The implementation of these operators assumes that the coordinates of a Point object are integers. If the coordinates were of a different data type, the implementation of these operators would need to be adjusted accordingly.

## extra solution

Here's a C++ program that implements the functions described in question 3 and the additional functions in the subsequent questions:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

class Shape {
public:
    virtual double area() {
        return 0;
    }
};

class Rectangle : public Shape {
public:
    Rectangle(double w, double h) : width(w), height(h) {
        cout << "Constructing a rectangle..." << endl;
    }

    ~Rectangle() {
        cout << "Destructing a rectangle..." << endl;
    }

    double area() {
        return width * height;
    }

protected:
    double width, height;
};

class Square : public Rectangle {
public:
    Square(double s) : Rectangle(s, s) {
        cout << "Constructing a square..." << endl;
    }

    ~Square() {
        cout << "Destructing a square..." << endl;
    }
};

class Circle : public Shape {
public:
    Circle(double r) : radius(r) {
        cout << "Constructing a circle..." << endl;
    }

    ~Circle() {
        cout << "Destructing a circle..." << endl;
    }

    double area() {
        return M_PI * pow(radius, 2);
    }

protected:
    double radius;
};

int main() {
    Shape* shapes[3];
    shapes[0] = new Rectangle(5, 10);
    shapes[1] = new Square(7);
    shapes[2] = new Circle(4);

    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        cout << "Area of shape " << i+1 << ": " << shapes[i]->area() << endl;
        delete shapes[i];
    }

    system("pause");
    return 0;
}
```

The program starts by defining a base class `Shape` with a virtual `area()` method, which will be overridden by the derived classes.

The program then defines two derived classes from `Shape`: `Rectangle` and `Circle`. The `Rectangle` class has a constructor that takes the width and height of the rectangle as parameters, and a `~Rectangle()` destructor. The `Rectangle` class also overrides the `area()` method to calculate the area of the rectangle. The `Square` class is derived from `Rectangle` and has a constructor that takes the length of a side of the square as a parameter. The `Square` constructor calls the `Rectangle` constructor with the side length as both the width and height.

The `Circle` class has a constructor that takes the radius of the circle as a parameter, and a `~Circle()` destructor. The `Circle` class also overrides the `area()` method to calculate the area of the circle.

In the `main()` function, an array of `Shape` pointers is created to hold objects of the derived classes. Three objects are created and stored in the array: a `Rectangle` object with width 5 and height 10, a `Square` object with side length 7, and a `Circle` object with radius 4.

A `for` loop then iterates through the array, calling the `area()` method of each object and outputting the area to the console. The objects are then deleted using the `delete` operator, which calls their respective destructors.

The program also uses `system("pause")` to pause the program before exiting, so that the user can view the console output.

(1) To define the method for calculating the area in the base class `Shape` as a virtual function, we need to modify the `Shape` class to include the keyword `virtual` before the `area()` method declaration. This allows derived classes to override the method with their own implementation of `area()`. Here is the modified `Shape` class:

```cpp
class Shape {
public:
    virtual double area() {
        return 0;
    }
};
```

In the `Rectangle` and `Circle` classes, we can now override the `area()` method with their own implementations. This allows us to call the `area()` method on an object of the base class `Shape`, and have it correctly call the overridden method in the derived classes.

(2) To define the base class in `Shape` as an abstract class, we need to modify the `Shape` class to include a pure virtual function. A pure virtual function is a virtual function with no implementation in the base class, and it is declared using `= 0`. Here is the modified `Shape` class:

```cpp
class Shape {
public:
    virtual double area() = 0;
};
```

In the `Rectangle` and `Circle` classes, we can now override the `area()` method with their own implementations. However, since the `Shape` class now has a pure virtual function, it cannot be instantiated directly. This forces us to create objects of the derived classes instead, which ensures that we have an implementation of the `area()` method for each object.
