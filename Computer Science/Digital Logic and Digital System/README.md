Introduction:

Digital Logic and Digital System are two related fields of study in electrical engineering and computer science that deal with the design, analysis, and implementation of digital circuits and systems. Digital circuits and systems are those that use a discrete set of values to represent and process information, as opposed to analog circuits and systems which use continuous values.

Digital Logic refers to the study of digital circuits and systems at the gate and circuit level. It involves the use of Boolean algebra, logic gates, combinational logic, and sequential logic to design and analyze digital circuits and systems.

Digital System refers to the study of digital circuits and systems at the system level. It involves the use of basic components such as logic gates, flip-flops, and registers to design and analyze digital systems such as microprocessors, digital signal processors, and digital control systems.

In this outline, we will provide an overview of Digital Logic and Digital System, including their basic components, design and analysis techniques, and applications.
