# Chapter 2: Combinational Logic

## 2.1 Combinational Logic Analysis

This section discusses the analysis of combinational logic circuits, which are circuits that produce an output based solely on the current input values. The section covers Boolean algebra and truth tables, which are used to analyze and describe combinational logic circuits.



## 2.2 Combinational Logic Design

This section covers the design of combinational logic circuits, which involves selecting appropriate logic gates and connecting them to produce the desired output. The section includes examples of common combinational logic circuits, such as adders and multiplexers.

## 2.3 Equivalent Transformations of Combinational Logic Circuits

This section covers equivalent transformations of combinational logic circuits, which are transformations that preserve the input-output behavior of the circuit. The section includes examples of equivalent transformations, such as the distributive law and De Morgan's law.

## 2.4 Data Selectors and Distributors

This section covers data selectors and distributors, which are combinational logic circuits that select or distribute data based on control signals. The section includes examples of common data selectors and distributors, such as multiplexers and demultiplexers.

## 2.5 Decoders

This section covers decoders, which are combinational logic circuits that convert a binary code into a set of output signals. The section includes examples of common decoders, such as binary-to-decimal decoders and address decoders.

## 2.6 Encoders

This section covers encoders, which are combinational logic circuits that convert a set of input signals into a binary code. The section includes examples of common encoders, such as priority encoders and decimal-to-binary encoders.

## 2.7 Data Comparators and Adders

This section covers data comparators and adders, which are combinational logic circuits that compare or add two sets of data. The section includes examples of common data comparators and adders, such as magnitude comparators and ripple-carry adders.

## 2.8 Parity Checkers

This section covers parity checkers, which are combinational logic circuits that check for errors in data transmission. The section includes examples of common parity checkers, such as even parity checkers and odd parity checkers.
