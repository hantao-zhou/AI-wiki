# 2612. Minimum Reverse Operations: 

You are given an integer n and an integer p in the range [0, n - 1]. Representing a 0-indexed array arr of length n where all positions are set to 0's, except position p which is set to 1. You are also given an integer array banned containing some positions from the array. For the ith position in banned, arr[banned[i]] = 0, and banned[i] != p. You can perform multiple operations on arr. In an operation, you can choose a subarray with size k and reverse the subarray. However, the 1 in arr should never go to any of the positions in banned. In other words, after each operation arr[banned[i]] remains 0. Return an array ans where for each i from [0, n - 1], ans[i] is the minimum number of reverse operations needed to bring the 1 to position i in arr, or -1 if it is impossible. A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array. The values of ans[i] are independent for all i's. The reverse of an array is an array containing the values in reverse order. Example 1: Input: n = 4, p = 0, banned = [1,2], k = 4 Output: [0,-1,-1,1] Explanation: In this case k = 4 so there is only one possible reverse operation we can perform, which is reversing the whole array. Initially, 1 is placed at position 0 so the amount of operations we need for position 0 is 0. We can never place a 1 on the banned positions, so the answer for positions 1 and 2 is -1. Finally, with one reverse operation we can bring the 1 to index 3, so the answer for position 3 is 1. Example 2: Input: n = 5, p = 0, banned = [2,4], k = 3 Output: [0,-1,-1,-1,-1] Explanation: In this case the 1 is initially at position 0, so the answer for that position is 0. We can perform reverse operations of size 3. The 1 is currently located at position 0, so we need to reverse the subarray [0, 2] for it to leave that position, but reversing that subarray makes position 2 have a 1, which shouldn't happen. So, we can't move the 1 from position 0, making the result for all the other positions -1. Example 3: Input: n = 4, p = 2, banned = [0,1,3], k = 1 Output: [-1,-1,0,-1] Explanation: In this case we can only perform reverse operations of size 1. So the 1 never changes its position. Constraints: 1 <= n <= 105 0 <= p <= n - 1 0 <= banned.length <= n - 1 0 <= banned[i] <= n - 1 1 <= k <= n banned[i] != p all values in banned are unique

---
You are given an integer `n` and an integer `p` in the range `[0, n - 1]`. Representing a **0-indexed** array `arr` of length `n` where all positions are set to `0`'s, except position `p` which is set to `1`.

You are also given an integer array `banned` containing some positions from the array. For the **i**<sup><strong>th</strong></sup> position in `banned`, `arr[banned[i]] = 0`, and `banned[i] != p`.

You can perform **multiple** operations on `arr`. In an operation, you can choose a **subarray** with size `k` and **reverse** the subarray. However, the `1` in `arr` should never go to any of the positions in `banned`. In other words, after each operation `arr[banned[i]]` **remains** `0`.

_Return an array_ `ans` _where_ _for each_ `i` _from_ `[0, n - 1]`, `ans[i]` _is the **minimum** number of reverse operations needed to bring the_ `1` _to position_ `i` _in arr_, _or_ `-1` _if it is impossible_.

-   A **subarray** is a contiguous **non-empty** sequence of elements within an array.
-   The values of `ans[i]` are independent for all `i`'s.
-   The **reverse** of an array is an array containing the values in **reverse order**.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 4, p = 0, banned = [1,2], k = 4
Output: [0,-1,-1,1]
Explanation: In this case k = 4 so there is only one possible reverse operation we can perform, which is reversing the whole array. Initially, 1 is placed at position 0 so the amount of operations we need for position 0 is 0. We can never place a 1 on the banned positions, so the answer for positions 1 and 2 is -1. Finally, with one reverse operation we can bring the 1 to index 3, so the answer for position 3 is 1. 

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 5, p = 0, banned = [2,4], k = 3
Output: [0,-1,-1,-1,-1]
Explanation: In this case the 1 is initially at position 0, so the answer for that position is 0. We can perform reverse operations of size 3. The 1 is currently located at position 0, so we need to reverse the subarray [0, 2] for it to leave that position, but reversing that subarray makes position 2 have a 1, which shouldn't happen. So, we can't move the 1 from position 0, making the result for all the other positions -1. 

```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 4, p = 2, banned = [0,1,3], k = 1
Output: [-1,-1,0,-1]
Explanation: In this case we can only perform reverse operations of size 1. So the 1 never changes its position.

```

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= n <= 10<sup>5</sup>`
-   `0 <= p <= n - 1`
-   `0 <= banned.length <= n - 1`
-   `0 <= banned[i] <= n - 1`
-   `1 <= k <= n` 
-   `banned[i] != p`
-   all values in `banned` are **unique**

## wrong 1
Here's the Python solution to the problem:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def minReverseOperations(self, n: int, p: int, banned: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        # Initialize the result array with -1 for all positions
        ans = [-1] * n
        
        # Set the initial position of 1
        ans[p] = 0
        
        # Sort the banned positions in ascending order
        banned.sort()
        
        # Iterate over all positions in the array
        for i in range(n):
            # If this position is banned, skip it
            if i in banned:
                continue
            
            # Calculate the distance between the current position and the initial position of 1
            dist = abs(i - p)
            
            # If the distance is less than k, we can reach this position in one operation
            if dist < k:
                ans[i] = 1
            
            # Otherwise, we need to reverse a subarray of size k to reach this position
            else:
                # Calculate the starting and ending positions of the subarray
                start = max(0, i - k + 1)
                end = min(i, n - k)
                
                # Check if the subarray contains any banned positions
                if any(start <= b < start + k or end <= b < end + k for b in banned):
                    ans[i] = -1
                else:
                    ans[i] = 1
        
        return ans
```

In this solution, we first initialize the result array `ans` with -1 for all positions, except for the initial position of 1 which is set to 0. We then sort the banned positions in ascending order and iterate over all positions in the array.

For each position, we calculate the distance between the current position and the initial position of 1. If the distance is less than k, we can reach this position in one operation. Otherwise, we need to reverse a subarray of size k to reach this position.

We calculate the starting and ending positions of the subarray and check if it contains any banned positions. If it does, we set the result for this position to -1. Otherwise, we set it to 1.

Finally, we return the result array `ans`.

## 2

You are correct, I apologize for the mistake in my previous answer. The code I provided has an error in the logic for calculating the minimum number of reverse operations needed to bring the 1 to each position.

Here is the corrected Python solution:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def minReverseOperations(self, n: int, p: int, banned: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        # Initialize the result array with -1 for all positions
        ans = [-1] * n
        
        # Set the initial position of 1
        ans[p] = 0
        
        # Sort the banned positions in ascending order
        banned.sort()
        
        # Iterate over all positions in the array
        for i in range(n):
            # If this position is banned, skip it
            if i in banned:
                continue
            
            # Calculate the distance between the current position and the initial position of 1
            dist = abs(i - p)
            
            # If the distance is a multiple of k, we can reach this position in dist/k operations
            if dist % k == 0:
                ans[i] = dist // k
            
            # Otherwise, we need to reverse a subarray of size k to reach this position
            else:
                # Calculate the starting and ending positions of the subarray
                start = max(0, i - k + 1)
                end = min(i, n - k)
                
                # Check if the subarray contains any banned positions
                if any(start <= b < start + k or end <= b < end + k for b in banned):
                    ans[i] = -1
                else:
                    ans[i] = (dist // k) + 1
        
        return ans
```

In this corrected solution, we follow the same approach as before, but with a corrected logic for calculating the minimum number of reverse operations needed to bring the 1 to each position.

For each position, we calculate the distance between the current position and the initial position of 1. If the distance is a multiple of k, we can reach this position in `dist/k` operations. Otherwise, we need to reverse a subarray of size k to reach this position, which takes `(dist//k) + 1` operations.

We then check if the subarray contains any banned positions, and if it does, we set the result for this position to -1. Otherwise, we set it to the calculated number of operations.

I hope this solution resolves the issue for you.
