# What does the course Operating Systems mainly teach in University

In university, a course on operating systems typically teaches students about the fundamental concepts and principles of operating systems, which are the software programs that manage computer hardware and software resources and provide a platform for running other applications.

Some of the topics that are typically covered in an operating systems course include:

1. Processes and threads: the basic unit of execution in an operating system, and how they are managed and scheduled by the operating system.

2. Memory management: how the operating system manages the allocation and deallocation of memory to running processes and ensures that each process has access only to its own memory space.

3. Input/output (I/O) management: how the operating system manages the flow of data between the CPU, memory, and I/O devices such as disks, printers, and networks.

4. File systems: how the operating system manages the storage and retrieval of files on disk, including issues such as file naming, directory structures, and access control.

5. Security: how the operating system provides security mechanisms to protect against unauthorized access, including authentication, authorization, and encryption.

6. Virtualization: how the operating system can create virtual machines or containers to provide multiple isolated environments on a single physical machine.

7. Distributed systems: how the operating system can be used to manage distributed systems, including issues such as distributed file systems, distributed synchronization, and distributed resource allocation.

Overall, an operating systems course aims to provide students with a deep understanding of how an operating system works, and how it can be used to manage computer resources effectively and efficiently.
