In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), a **surface** is a [mathematical model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model "Mathematical model") of the common concept of a [surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface "Surface"). It is a generalization of a [plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(mathematics) "Plane (mathematics)"), but, unlike a plane, it may be [curved](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curvature "Curvature"); this is analogous to a [curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve "Curve") generalizing a [straight line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_line "Straight line").

There are several more precise definitions, depending on the context and the mathematical tools that are used for the study. The simplest mathematical surfaces are planes and [spheres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere "Sphere") in the [Euclidean 3-space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_3-space "Euclidean 3-space"). The exact definition of a surface may depend on the context. Typically, in [algebraic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_geometry "Algebraic geometry"), a surface may cross itself (and may have other [singularities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_point_of_an_algebraic_variety "Singular point of an algebraic variety")), while, in [topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology "Topology") and [differential geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry "Differential geometry"), it may not.

A surface is a [topological space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space "Topological space") of [dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension "Dimension") two; this means that a moving point on a surface may move in two directions (it has two [degrees of freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrees_of_freedom "Degrees of freedom")). In other words, around almost every point, there is a _[coordinate patch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_patch "Coordinate patch")_ on which a two-dimensional [coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_system "Coordinate system") is defined. For example, the surface of the Earth resembles (ideally) a two-dimensional [sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere "Sphere"), and [latitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitude "Latitude") and [longitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude "Longitude") provide two-dimensional coordinates on it (except at the poles and along the [180th meridian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/180th_meridian "180th meridian")).

## Definitions\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Surface_(mathematics)&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Definitions")\]

Often, a surface is defined by [equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation "Equation") that are satisfied by the [coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate "Coordinate") of its points. This is the case of the [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_of_a_function "Graph of a function") of a [continuous function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function "Continuous function") of two variables. The set of the [zeros of a function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_of_a_function "Zero of a function") of three variables is a surface, which is called an [implicit surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit_surface "Implicit surface").<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(mathematics)#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> If the defining three-variate function is a [polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial "Polynomial"), the surface is an [algebraic surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_surface "Algebraic surface"). For example, the [unit sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_sphere "Unit sphere") is an algebraic surface, as it may be defined by the [implicit equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit_equation "Implicit equation")

![{\displaystyle x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}-1=0.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/334e6c81f012b997be35eee5f5d91d89ef7c9d50)

A surface may also be defined as the [image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_(mathematics) "Image (mathematics)"), in some space of [dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension "Dimension") at least 3, of a [continuous function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function "Continuous function") of two variables (some further conditions are required to insure that the image is not a [curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve "Curve")). In this case, one says that one has a [parametric surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_surface "Parametric surface"), which is _parametrized_ by these two variables, called _parameters_. For example, the unit sphere may be parametrized by the [Euler angles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_angles "Euler angles"), also called [longitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude "Longitude") u and [latitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitude "Latitude") v by

![{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}x&=\cos(u)\cos(v)\\y&=\sin(u)\cos(v)\\z&=\sin(v)\,.\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d7f1515471c9353718fdefb096e071dc08a0d073)

Parametric equations of surfaces are often irregular at some points. For example, all but two points of the unit sphere, are the image, by the above parametrization, of exactly one pair of Euler angles ([modulo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation "Modulo operation") 2π). For the remaining two points (the [north](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Pole "North Pole") and [south poles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Pole "South Pole")), one has cos _v_ = 0, and the longitude _u_ may take any values. Also, there are surfaces for which there cannot exist a single parametrization that covers the whole surface. Therefore, one often considers surfaces which are parametrized by several parametric equations, whose images cover the surface. This is formalized by the concept of [manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold "Manifold"): in the context of manifolds, typically in [topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology "Topology") and [differential geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry "Differential geometry"), a surface is a manifold of dimension two; this means that a surface is a [topological space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space "Topological space") such that every point has a [neighborhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighborhood "Neighborhood") which is [homeomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeomorphism "Homeomorphism") to an [open subset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_subset "Open subset") of the [Euclidean plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_plane "Euclidean plane") (see [Surface (topology)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(topology) "Surface (topology)") and [Surface (differential geometry)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(differential_geometry) "Surface (differential geometry)")). This allows defining surfaces in spaces of dimension higher than three, and even _abstract surfaces_, which are not contained in any other space. On the other hand, this excludes surfaces that have [singularities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singularity_theory "Singularity theory"), such as the vertex of a [conical surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conical_surface "Conical surface") or points where a surface crosses itself.

In [classical geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_geometry "Classical geometry"), a surface is generally defined as a [locus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_(mathematics) "Locus (mathematics)") of a point or a line. For example, a [sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere "Sphere") is the locus of a point which is at a given distance of a fixed point, called the center; a [conical surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conical_surface "Conical surface") is the locus of a line passing through a fixed point and crossing a [curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve "Curve"); a [surface of revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_of_revolution "Surface of revolution") is the locus of a curve rotating around a line. A [ruled surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruled_surface "Ruled surface") is the locus of a moving line satisfying some constraints; in modern terminology, a ruled surface is a surface, which is a [union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_(set_theory) "Union (set theory)") of lines.

## Terminology\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Surface_(mathematics)&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Terminology")\]

There are several kinds of surfaces that are considered in mathematics. An unambiguous terminology is thus necessary to distinguish them when needed. A _[topological surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_surface "Topological surface")_ is a surface that is a [manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold "Manifold") of dimension two (see [§ Tological surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(mathematics)#Tological_surface)). A _[differentiable surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_surface "Differentiable surface")_ is a surfaces that is a [differentiable manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_manifold "Differentiable manifold") (see [§ Differentiable surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(mathematics)#Differentiable_surface)). Every differentiable surface is a topological surface, but the converse is false.

A "surface" is often implicitly supposed to be contained in a [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space") of dimension 3, typically **R**<sup>3</sup>. A surface that is contained in a [projective space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_space "Projective space") is called a [projective surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_surface "Projective surface") (see [§ Projective surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(mathematics)#Projective_surface)). A surface that is not supposed to be included in another space is called an _abstract surface_.

## Examples\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Surface_(mathematics)&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Examples")\]

-   The [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_of_a_function "Graph of a function") of a [continuous function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function "Continuous function") of two variables, defined over a [connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected_space "Connected space") [open subset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_subset "Open subset") of **R**<sup>2</sup> is a _topological surface_. If the function is [differentiable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_function "Differentiable function"), the graph is a _differentiable surface_.
-   A [plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(geometry) "Plane (geometry)") is both an [algebraic surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_surface "Algebraic surface") and a differentiable surface. It is also a [ruled surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruled_surface "Ruled surface") and a [surface of revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_of_revolution "Surface of revolution").
-   A [circular cylinder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_cylinder "Circular cylinder") (that is, the [locus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_(mathematics) "Locus (mathematics)") of a line crossing a circle and parallel to a given direction) is an algebraic surface and a differentiable surface.
-   A [circular cone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conical_surface "Conical surface") (locus of a line crossing a circle, and passing through a fixed point, the _apex_, which is outside the plane of the circle) is an algebraic surface which is not a differentiable surface. If one removes the apex, the remainder of the cone is the union of two differentiable surfaces.
-   The surface of a [polyhedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyhedron "Polyhedron") is a topological surface, which is neither a differentiable surface nor an algebraic surface.
-   A [hyperbolic paraboloid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_paraboloid "Hyperbolic paraboloid") (the graph of the function _z_ = _xy_) is a differentiable surface and an algebraic surface. It is also a ruled surface, and, for this reason, is often used in [architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture "Architecture").
-   A [two-sheet hyperboloid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-sheet_hyperboloid "Two-sheet hyperboloid") is an algebraic surface and the union of two non-intersecting differentiable surfaces.

## Parametric surface\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Surface_(mathematics)&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Parametric surface")\]

A **parametric surface** is the image of an open subset of the [Euclidean plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_plane "Euclidean plane") (typically ![\mathbb {R} ^{2}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e150115ab9f63023215109595b76686a1ff890fd)) by a [continuous function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function "Continuous function"), in a [topological space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space "Topological space"), generally a [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space") of dimension at least three. Usually the function is supposed to be [continuously differentiable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuously_differentiable "Continuously differentiable"), and this will be always the case in this article.

Specifically, a parametric surface in ![\mathbb {R} ^{3}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f936ddf584f8f3dd2a0ed08917001b7a404c10b5) is given by three functions of two variables u and v, called _parameters_

![{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}x&=f_{1}(u,v)\\y&=f_{2}(u,v)\\z&=f_{3}(u,v)\,.\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ed72552776e1085fdd0dbe240df907e420990f45)

As the image of such a function may be a [curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve "Curve") (for example, if the three functions are constant with respect to v), a further condition is required, generally that, for [almost all](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almost_all "Almost all") values of the parameters, the [Jacobian matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobian_matrix "Jacobian matrix")

![{\displaystyle {\begin{bmatrix}{\dfrac {\partial f_{1}}{\partial u}}&{\dfrac {\partial f_{1}}{\partial v}}\\{\dfrac {\partial f_{2}}{\partial u}}&{\dfrac {\partial f_{2}}{\partial v}}\\{\dfrac {\partial f_{3}}{\partial u}}&{\dfrac {\partial f_{3}}{\partial v}}\\\end{bmatrix}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5ef0ff5ed051cce583868cebf15e9874b7570237)

has [rank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rank_of_a_matrix "Rank of a matrix") two. Here "almost all" means that the values of the parameters where the rank is two contain a [dense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dense_subset "Dense subset") [open subset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_subset "Open subset") of the range of the parametrization. For surfaces in a space of higher dimension, the condition is the same, except for the number of columns of the Jacobian matrix.

### Tangent plane and normal vector\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Surface_(mathematics)&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Tangent plane and normal vector")\]

A point p where the above Jacobian matrix has rank two is called _regular_, or, more properly, the parametrization is called _regular_ at p.

The _[tangent plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_plane "Tangent plane")_ at a regular point p is the unique plane passing through p and having a direction parallel to the two [row vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row_vector "Row vector") of the Jacobian matrix. The tangent plane is an [affine concept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_property "Affine property"), because its definition is independent of the choice of a [metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_(mathematics) "Metric (mathematics)"). In other words, any [affine transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_transformation "Affine transformation") maps the tangent plane to the surface at a point to the tangent plane to the image of the surface at the image of the point.

The _[normal line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_line "Normal line")_ at a point of a surface is the unique line passing through the point and perpendicular to the tangent plane; the _normal vector_ is a vector which is parallel to the normal.

For other [differential invariants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_invariant "Differential invariant") of surfaces, in the neighborhood of a point, see [Differential geometry of surfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry_of_surfaces "Differential geometry of surfaces").

### Irregular point and singular point\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Surface_(mathematics)&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Irregular point and singular point")\]

A point of a parametric surface which is not regular is **irregular**. There are several kinds of irregular points.

It may occur that an irregular point becomes regular, if one changes the parametrization. This is the case of the poles in the parametrization of the [unit sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_sphere "Unit sphere") by [Euler angles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_angles "Euler angles"): it suffices to permute the role of the different [coordinate axes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_axes "Coordinate axes") for changing the poles.

On the other hand, consider the [circular cone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_cone "Circular cone") of parametric equation

![{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}x&=t\cos(u)\\y&=t\sin(u)\\z&=t\,.\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c98c1d8df3664bc5fe446df0885762d041ce3e52)

The apex of the cone is the origin (0, 0, 0), and is obtained for _t_ = 0. It is an irregular point that remains irregular, whichever parametrization is chosen (otherwise, there would exist a unique tangent plane). Such an irregular point, where the tangent plane is undefined, is said **singular**.

There is another kind of singular points. There are the **self-crossing points**, that is the points where the surface crosses itself. In other words, these are the points which are obtained for (at least) two different values of the parameters.

### Graph of a bivariate function\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Surface_(mathematics)&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Graph of a bivariate function")\]

Let _z_ = _f_(_x_, _y_) be a function of two real variables. This is a parametric surface, parametrized as

![{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}x&=t\\y&=u\\z&=f(t,u)\,.\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d1f93d014e3ff1a6b8284ed13babc697ad0e9aa4)

Every point of this surface is regular, as the two first columns of the Jacobian matrix form the [identity matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_matrix "Identity matrix") of rank two.

### Rational surface\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Surface_(mathematics)&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Rational surface")\]

A **rational surface** is a surface that may be parametrized by [rational functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_functions "Rational functions") of two variables. That is, if _f<sub>i</sub>_(_t_, _u_) are, for _i_ = 0, 1, 2, 3, [polynomials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial "Polynomial") in two indeterminates, then the parametric surface, defined by

![{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}x&={\frac {f_{1}(t,u)}{f_{0}(t,u)}}\\y&={\frac {f_{2}(t,u)}{f_{0}(t,u)}}\\z&={\frac {f_{3}(t,u)}{f_{0}(t,u)}}\,,\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/474d8108d78bf65025756fe1e86d780f42b26713)

is a rational surface.

A rational surface is an [algebraic surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_surface "Algebraic surface"), but most algebraic surfaces are not rational.

## Implicit surface\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Surface_(mathematics)&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Implicit surface")\]

An implicit surface in a [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space") (or, more generally, in an [affine space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_space "Affine space")) of dimension 3 is the set of the common zeros of a [differentiable function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_function "Differentiable function") of three variables

![{\displaystyle f(x,y,z)=0.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/73bb361249d50b3d1b54bb7b834c72b2313bf263)

Implicit means that the equation defines implicitly one of the variables as a function of the other variables. This is made more exact by the [implicit function theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit_function_theorem "Implicit function theorem"): if _f_(_x_<sub>0</sub>, _y_<sub>0</sub>, _z_<sub>0</sub>) = 0, and the partial derivative in z of f is not zero at (_x_<sub>0</sub>, _y_<sub>0</sub>, _z_<sub>0</sub>), then there exists a differentiable function _φ_(_x_, _y_) such that

![{\displaystyle f(x,y,\varphi (x,y))=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/cfb88fad3d86ec00dfa65a6288322526c94ad35f)

in a [neighbourhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighbourhood_(mathematics) "Neighbourhood (mathematics)") of (_x_<sub>0</sub>, _y_<sub>0</sub>, _z_<sub>0</sub>). In other words, the implicit surface is the [graph of a function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_of_a_function "Graph of a function") near a point of the surface where the partial derivative in z is nonzero. An implicit surface has thus, locally, a parametric representation, except at the points of the surface where the three partial derivatives are zero.

### Regular points and tangent plane\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Surface_(mathematics)&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Regular points and tangent plane")\]

A point of the surface where at least one partial derivative of f is nonzero is called **regular**. At such a point ![(x_{0},y_{0},z_{0})](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/39177ddeeb9f9a393b664e522bc8e3bf0face153), the tangent plane and the direction of the normal are well defined, and may be deduced, with the implicit function theorem from the definition given above, in [§ Tangent plane and normal vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(mathematics)#Tangent_plane_and_normal_vector). The direction of the normal is the [gradient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient "Gradient"), that is the vector

![{\displaystyle \left[{\frac {\partial f}{\partial x}}(x_{0},y_{0},z_{0}),{\frac {\partial f}{\partial y}}(x_{0},y_{0},z_{0}),{\frac {\partial f}{\partial z}}(x_{0},y_{0},z_{0})\right].}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9b93753ba36c47db43d602f08750ff6c02d8d208)

The tangent plane is defined by its implicit equation

![{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial f}{\partial x}}(x_{0},y_{0},z_{0})(x-x_{0})+{\frac {\partial f}{\partial y}}(x_{0},y_{0},z_{0})(y-y_{0})+{\frac {\partial f}{\partial z}}(x_{0},y_{0},z_{0})(z-z_{0})=0.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/485400d3ef3385aab9d7f6262b588134312152f7)

### Singular point\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Surface_(mathematics)&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Singular point")\]

A **singular point** of an implicit surface (in ![\mathbb {R} ^{3}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f936ddf584f8f3dd2a0ed08917001b7a404c10b5)) is a point of the surface where the implicit equation holds and the three partial derivatives of its defining function are all zero. Therefore, the singular points are the solutions of a [system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_equations "Simultaneous equations") of four equations in three indeterminates. As most such systems have no solution, many surfaces do not have any singular point. A surface with no singular point is called _regular_ or _non-singular_.

The study of surfaces near their singular points and the classification of the singular points is [singularity theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singularity_theory "Singularity theory"). A singular point is [isolated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolated_singularity "Isolated singularity") if there is no other singular point in a neighborhood of it. Otherwise, the singular points may form a curve. This is in particular the case for self-crossing surfaces.

## Algebraic surface\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Surface_(mathematics)&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Algebraic surface")\]

Originally, an algebraic surface was a surface which may be defined by an implicit equation

![{\displaystyle f(x,y,z)=0,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2ae769b413860f6ae5461aae7ade41b990332f1b)

where _f_ is a polynomial in three [indeterminates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indeterminate_(variable) "Indeterminate (variable)"), with real coefficients.

The concept has been extended in several directions, by defining surfaces over arbitrary [fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics) "Field (mathematics)"), and by considering surfaces in spaces of arbitrary dimension or in [projective spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_space "Projective space"). Abstract algebraic surfaces, which are not explicitly embedded in another space, are also considered.

### Surfaces over arbitrary fields\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Surface_(mathematics)&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Surfaces over arbitrary fields")\]

Polynomials with coefficients in any [field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics) "Field (mathematics)") are accepted for defining an algebraic surface. However, the field of coefficients of a polynomial is not well defined, as, for example, a polynomial with [rational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_number "Rational number") coefficients may also be considered as a polynomial with [real](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number") or [complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number "Complex number") coefficients. Therefore, the concept of _point_ of the surface has been generalized in the following way.<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(mathematics)#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup><sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This citation requires a reference to the specific page or range of pages in which the material appears. (February 2022)">page&nbsp;needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

Given a polynomial _f_(_x_, _y_, _z_), let _k_ be the smallest field containing the coefficients, and _K_ be an [algebraically closed extension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraically_closed_extension "Algebraically closed extension") of _k_, of infinite [transcendence degree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendence_degree "Transcendence degree").<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(mathematics)#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> Then a _point_ of the surface is an element of _K_<sup>3</sup> which is a solution of the equation

![{\displaystyle f(x,y,z)=0.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/73bb361249d50b3d1b54bb7b834c72b2313bf263)

If the polynomial has real coefficients, the field _K_ is the [complex field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_field "Complex field"), and a point of the surface that belongs to ![\mathbb {R} ^{3}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f936ddf584f8f3dd2a0ed08917001b7a404c10b5) (a usual point) is called a _real point_. A point that belongs to _k_<sup>3</sup> is called _rational over k_, or simply a _rational point_, if _k_ is the field of [rational numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_number "Rational number").

### Projective surface\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Surface_(mathematics)&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Projective surface")\]

A **projective surface** in a [projective space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_space "Projective space") of dimension three is the set of points whose [homogeneous coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_coordinates "Homogeneous coordinates") are zeros of a single [homogeneous polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_polynomial "Homogeneous polynomial") in four variables. More generally, a projective surface is a subset of a projective space, which is a [projective variety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_variety "Projective variety") of [dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension_of_an_algebraic_variety "Dimension of an algebraic variety") two.

Projective surfaces are strongly related to affine surfaces (that is, ordinary algebraic surfaces). One passes from a projective surface to the corresponding affine surface by setting to one some coordinate or indeterminate of the defining polynomials (usually the last one). Conversely, one passes from an affine surface to its associated projective surface (called _projective completion_) by [homogenizing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_polynomial#Homogenization "Homogeneous polynomial") the defining polynomial (in case of surfaces in a space of dimension three), or by homogenizing all polynomials of the defining ideal (for surfaces in a space of higher dimension).

### In higher dimensional spaces\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Surface_(mathematics)&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: In higher dimensional spaces")\]

One cannot define the concept of an algebraic surface in a space of dimension higher than three without a general definition of an [algebraic variety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_variety "Algebraic variety") and of the [dimension of an algebraic variety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension_of_an_algebraic_variety "Dimension of an algebraic variety"). In fact, an algebraic surface is an _algebraic variety of dimension two_.

More precisely, an algebraic surface in a space of dimension n is the set of the common zeros of at least _n_ – 2 polynomials, but these polynomials must satisfy further conditions that may be not immediate to verify. Firstly, the polynomials must not define a variety or an [algebraic set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_set "Algebraic set") of higher dimension, which is typically the case if one of the polynomials is in the [ideal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_(ring_theory) "Ideal (ring theory)") generated by the others. Generally, _n_ – 2 polynomials define an algebraic set of dimension two or higher. If the dimension is two, the algebraic set may have several [irreducible components](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreducible_component "Irreducible component"). If there is only one component the _n_ – 2 polynomials define a surface, which is a [complete intersection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_intersection "Complete intersection"). If there are several components, then one needs further polynomials for selecting a specific component.

Most authors consider as an algebraic surface only algebraic varieties of dimension two, but some also consider as surfaces all algebraic sets whose irreducible components have the dimension two.

In the case of surfaces in a space of dimension three, every surface is a complete intersection, and a surface is defined by a single polynomial, which is [irreducible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreducible_polynomial "Irreducible polynomial") or not, depending on whether non-irreducible algebraic sets of dimension two are considered as surfaces or not.

## Topological surface\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Surface_(mathematics)&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Topological surface")\]

In [topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology "Topology"), a surface is generally defined as a [manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold "Manifold") of dimension two. This means that a topological surface is a [topological space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space "Topological space") such that every point has a [neighborhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighborhood_(mathematics) "Neighborhood (mathematics)") that is [homeomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeomorphism "Homeomorphism") to an [open subset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_subset "Open subset") of a [Euclidean plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_plane "Euclidean plane").

Every topological surface is homeomorphic to a [polyhedral surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyhedral_surface "Polyhedral surface") such that all [facets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facet_(geometry) "Facet (geometry)") are [triangles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle "Triangle"). The [combinatorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorics "Combinatorics") study of such arrangements of triangles (or, more generally, of higher-dimensional [simplexes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex "Simplex")) is the starting object of [algebraic topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_topology "Algebraic topology"). This allows the characterization of the properties of surfaces in terms of purely algebraic [invariants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invariant_(mathematics) "Invariant (mathematics)"), such as the [genus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus_(mathematics) "Genus (mathematics)") and [homology groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_group "Homology group").

The homeomorphism classes of surfaces have been completely described (see [Surface (topology)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(topology) "Surface (topology)")).

## Differentiable surface\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Surface_(mathematics)&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Differentiable surface")\]

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/Bendixen_-_Carl_Friedrich_Gau%C3%9F%2C_1828.jpg/220px-Bendixen_-_Carl_Friedrich_Gau%C3%9F%2C_1828.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bendixen_-_Carl_Friedrich_Gau%C3%9F,_1828.jpg)

In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), the [differential geometry of surfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry_of_surfaces "Differential geometry of surfaces") deals with the [differential geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry "Differential geometry") of [smooth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_manifold "Smooth manifold") [surfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(topology) "Surface (topology)") with various additional structures, most often, a [Riemannian metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannian_metric "Riemannian metric"). Surfaces have been extensively studied from various perspectives: _extrinsically_, relating to their [embedding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedding "Embedding") in [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space") and _intrinsically_, reflecting their properties determined solely by the distance within the surface as measured along curves on the surface. One of the fundamental concepts investigated is the [Gaussian curvature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_curvature "Gaussian curvature"), first studied in depth by [Carl Friedrich Gauss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss "Carl Friedrich Gauss"),<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGauss1902_4-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(mathematics)#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGauss1902-4">[4]</a></sup> who showed that curvature was an intrinsic property of a surface, independent of its isometric embedding in Euclidean space.

Surfaces naturally arise as [graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_of_a_function "Graph of a function") of [functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics) "Function (mathematics)") of a pair of [variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics) "Variable (mathematics)"), and sometimes appear in parametric form or as [loci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_(mathematics) "Locus (mathematics)") associated to [space curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve#Definitions "Curve"). An important role in their study has been played by [Lie groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_group "Lie group") (in the spirit of the [Erlangen program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlangen_program "Erlangen program")), namely the [symmetry groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry_group "Symmetry group") of the [Euclidean plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_plane "Euclidean plane"), the [sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere "Sphere") and the [hyperbolic plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_plane "Hyperbolic plane"). These Lie groups can be used to describe surfaces of constant Gaussian curvature; they also provide an essential ingredient in the modern approach to intrinsic differential geometry through [connections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connection_(mathematics) "Connection (mathematics)"). On the other hand, extrinsic properties relying on an embedding of a surface in Euclidean space have also been extensively studied. This is well illustrated by the non-linear [Euler–Lagrange equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%E2%80%93Lagrange_equations "Euler–Lagrange equations") in the [calculus of variations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_of_variations "Calculus of variations"): although Euler developed the one variable equations to understand [geodesics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesics "Geodesics"), defined independently of an embedding, one of Lagrange's main applications of the two variable equations was to [minimal surfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_surfaces "Minimal surfaces"), a concept that can only be defined in terms of an embedding.

## Fractal surface\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Surface_(mathematics)&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: Fractal surface")\]

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/Animated_fractal_mountain.gif/300px-Animated_fractal_mountain.gif)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Animated_fractal_mountain.gif)

A [fractal landscape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal_landscape "Fractal landscape") or fractal surface is generated using a [stochastic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic "Stochastic") algorithm designed to produce [fractal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal "Fractal") behavior that mimics the appearance of natural [terrain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrain "Terrain"). In other words, the [surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface "Surface") resulting from the procedure is not a deterministic, but rather a random surface that exhibits fractal behavior.<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(mathematics)#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup>

Many natural phenomena exhibit some form of statistical [self-similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-similarity "Self-similarity") that can be modeled by [fractal surfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal_dimension#Fractal_surface_structures "Fractal dimension").<sup id="cite_ref-Fractal_landscape_Cham_6-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(mathematics)#cite_note-Fractal_landscape_Cham-6">[6]</a></sup> Moreover, variations in [surface texture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_texture "Surface texture") provide important visual cues to the orientation and slopes of surfaces, and the use of almost self-similar fractal patterns can help create natural looking visual effects.<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(mathematics)#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup> The modeling of the Earth's rough surfaces via [fractional Brownian motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional_Brownian_motion "Fractional Brownian motion") was first proposed by [Benoit Mandelbrot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benoit_Mandelbrot "Benoit Mandelbrot").<sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(mathematics)#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup>

Because the intended result of the process is to produce a landscape, rather than a mathematical function, processes are frequently applied to such landscapes that may affect the [stationarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stationary_process "Stationary process") and even the overall [fractal behavior of such a surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal_dimension#Fractal_surface_structures "Fractal dimension"), in the interests of producing a more convincing landscape.

According to [R. R. Shearer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhonda_Roland_Shearer "Rhonda Roland Shearer"), the generation of natural looking surfaces and landscapes was a major turning point in art history, where the distinction between geometric, [computer generated images](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_generated_imagery "Computer generated imagery") and natural, man made art became blurred.<sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(mathematics)#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> The first use of a fractal-generated landscape in a film was in 1982 for the movie _[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek_II:_The_Wrath_of_Khan "Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan")_.[Loren Carpenter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loren_Carpenter "Loren Carpenter") refined the techniques of Mandelbrot to create an alien landscape.<sup id="cite_ref-Fractal_landscape_ftpoc_10-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(mathematics)#cite_note-Fractal_landscape_ftpoc-10">[10]</a></sup>

In the part of mathematics referred to as [topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology "Topology"), a **surface** is a two-dimensional [manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold "Manifold"). Some surfaces arise as the [boundaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold#Manifold_with_boundary "Manifold") of three-dimensional solids; for example, the sphere is the boundary of the solid ball. Other surfaces arise as graphs of [functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics) "Function (mathematics)") of two variables; see the figure at right. However, surfaces can also be defined abstractly, without reference to any [ambient space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_space "Ambient space"). For example, the [Klein bottle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klein_bottle "Klein bottle") is a surface that cannot be [embedded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedding "Embedding") in three-dimensional [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space").

Topological surfaces are sometimes equipped with additional information, such as a [Riemannian metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannian_metric "Riemannian metric") or a complex structure, that connects them to other disciplines within mathematics, such as [differential geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry "Differential geometry") and [complex analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_analysis "Complex analysis"). The various [mathematical notions of surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(mathematics) "Surface (mathematics)") can be used to model [surfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface "Surface") in the physical world.

## In general\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Surface_(topology)&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: In general")\]

In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), a **surface** is a geometrical shape that resembles a deformed [plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(geometry) "Plane (geometry)"). The most familiar examples arise as boundaries of solid objects in ordinary three-dimensional [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space") **R**<sup>3</sup>, such as [spheres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere "Sphere"). The exact definition of a surface may depend on the context. Typically, in [algebraic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_geometry "Algebraic geometry"), a surface may cross itself (and may have other [singularities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_point_of_an_algebraic_variety "Singular point of an algebraic variety")), while, in [topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology "Topology") and [differential geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry "Differential geometry"), it may not.

A surface is a [two-dimensional space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-dimensional_space "Two-dimensional space"); this means that a moving point on a surface may move in two directions (it has two [degrees of freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrees_of_freedom "Degrees of freedom")). In other words, around almost every point, there is a _[coordinate patch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_patch "Coordinate patch")_ on which a two-dimensional [coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_system "Coordinate system") is defined. For example, the surface of the Earth resembles (ideally) a two-dimensional [sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere "Sphere"), and [latitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitude "Latitude") and [longitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude "Longitude") provide two-dimensional coordinates on it (except at the poles and along the [180th meridian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/180th_meridian "180th meridian")).

The concept of surface is widely used in [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics"), [engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering "Engineering"), [computer graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_graphics "Computer graphics"), and many other disciplines, primarily in representing the surfaces of physical objects. For example, in analyzing the [aerodynamic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerodynamics "Aerodynamics") properties of an [airplane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airplane "Airplane"), the central consideration is the flow of air along its surface.

## Definitions and first examples\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Surface_(topology)&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Definitions and first examples")\]

A _(topological) surface_ is a [topological space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space "Topological space") in which every point has an open [neighbourhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_neighbourhood "Topological neighbourhood") [homeomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeomorphism "Homeomorphism") to some [open subset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_set "Open set") of the Euclidean plane **E**<sup>2</sup>. Such a neighborhood, together with the corresponding homeomorphism, is known as a _(coordinate) chart_. It is through this chart that the neighborhood inherits the standard coordinates on the Euclidean plane. These coordinates are known as _local coordinates_ and these homeomorphisms lead us to describe surfaces as being _locally Euclidean_.

In most writings on the subject, it is often assumed, explicitly or implicitly, that as a topological space a surface is also nonempty, [second-countable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-countable_space "Second-countable space"), and [Hausdorff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausdorff_space "Hausdorff space"). It is also often assumed that the surfaces under consideration are connected.

The rest of this article will assume, unless specified otherwise, that a surface is nonempty, Hausdorff, second-countable, and connected.

More generally, a _(topological) surface with boundary_ is a [Hausdorff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausdorff_space "Hausdorff space") [topological space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space "Topological space") in which every point has an open [neighbourhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_neighbourhood "Topological neighbourhood") [homeomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeomorphism "Homeomorphism") to some [open subset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_set "Open set") of the closure of the [upper half-plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_half-plane "Upper half-plane") **H**<sup>2</sup> in **C**. These homeomorphisms are also known as _(coordinate) charts_. The boundary of the upper half-plane is the _x_\-axis. A point on the surface mapped via a chart to the _x_\-axis is termed a _boundary point_. The collection of such points is known as the _boundary_ of the surface which is necessarily a one-manifold, that is, the union of closed curves. On the other hand, a point mapped to above the _x_\-axis is an _interior point_. The collection of interior points is the _interior_ of the surface which is always non-[empty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empty_set "Empty set"). The closed [disk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_(mathematics) "Disk (mathematics)") is a simple example of a surface with boundary. The boundary of the disc is a circle.

The term _surface_ used without qualification refers to surfaces without boundary. In particular, a surface with empty boundary is a surface in the usual sense. A surface with empty boundary which is compact is known as a 'closed' surface. The two-dimensional sphere, the two-dimensional [torus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torus "Torus"), and the [real projective plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_projective_plane "Real projective plane") are examples of closed surfaces.

The [Möbius strip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6bius_strip "Möbius strip") is a surface on which the distinction between clockwise and counterclockwise can be defined locally, but not globally. In general, a surface is said to be _orientable_ if it does not contain a homeomorphic copy of the Möbius strip; intuitively, it has two distinct "sides". For example, the sphere and torus are orientable, while the real projective plane is not (because the real projective plane with one point removed is homeomorphic to the open Möbius strip).

In [differential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry "Differential geometry") and [algebraic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_geometry "Algebraic geometry"), extra structure is added upon the topology of the surface. This added structure can be a smoothness structure (making it possible to define differentiable maps to and from the surface), a [Riemannian metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannian_metric "Riemannian metric") (making it possible to define length and angles on the surface), a complex structure (making it possible to define holomorphic maps to and from the surface—in which case the surface is called a [Riemann surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_surface "Riemann surface")), or an algebraic structure (making it possible to detect [singularities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_point_of_an_algebraic_variety "Singular point of an algebraic variety"), such as self-intersections and cusps, that cannot be described solely in terms of the underlying topology).

## Extrinsically defined surfaces and embeddings\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Surface_(topology)&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Extrinsically defined surfaces and embeddings")\]

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Sphere_wireframe.svg/250px-Sphere_wireframe.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sphere_wireframe.svg)

A sphere can be defined parametrically (by _x_ = _r_ sin _θ_ cos _φ_, _y_ = _r_ sin _θ_ sin _φ_, _z_ = _r_ cos _θ_) or implicitly (by _x_<sup>2</sup> + _y_<sup>2</sup> + _z_<sup>2</sup> − _r_<sup>2</sup> = 0.)

Historically, surfaces were initially defined as subspaces of Euclidean spaces. Often, these surfaces were the [locus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_(mathematics) "Locus (mathematics)") of [zeros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_of_a_function "Root of a function") of certain functions, usually polynomial functions. Such a definition considered the surface as part of a larger (Euclidean) space, and as such was termed _extrinsic_.

In the previous section, a surface is defined as a topological space with certain properties, namely Hausdorff and locally Euclidean. This topological space is not considered a subspace of another space. In this sense, the definition given above, which is the definition that mathematicians use at present, is _intrinsic_.

A surface defined as intrinsic is not required to satisfy the added constraint of being a subspace of Euclidean space. It may seem possible for some surfaces defined intrinsically to not be surfaces in the extrinsic sense. However, the [Whitney embedding theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitney_embedding_theorem "Whitney embedding theorem") asserts every surface can in fact be embedded homeomorphically into Euclidean space, in fact into **E**<sup>4</sup>: The extrinsic and intrinsic approaches turn out to be equivalent.

In fact, any compact surface that is either orientable or has a boundary can be embedded in **E**<sup>3</sup>; on the other hand, the real projective plane, which is compact, non-orientable and without boundary, cannot be embedded into **E**<sup>3</sup> (see Gramain). [Steiner surfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steiner_surface "Steiner surface"), including [Boy's surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boy%27s_surface "Boy's surface"), the [Roman surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_surface "Roman surface") and the [cross-cap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-cap "Cross-cap"), are models of the real projective plane in **E**<sup>3</sup>, but only the Boy surface is an [immersed surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immersion_(mathematics) "Immersion (mathematics)"). All these models are singular at points where they intersect themselves.

The [Alexander horned sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_horned_sphere "Alexander horned sphere") is a well-known [pathological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathological_(mathematics) "Pathological (mathematics)") embedding of the two-sphere into the three-sphere.

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/KnottedTorus.svg/220px-KnottedTorus.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:KnottedTorus.svg)

The chosen embedding (if any) of a surface into another space is regarded as extrinsic information; it is not essential to the surface itself. For example, a torus can be embedded into **E**<sup>3</sup> in the "standard" manner (which looks like a [bagel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagel "Bagel")) or in a [knotted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_(mathematics) "Knot (mathematics)") manner (see figure). The two embedded tori are homeomorphic, but not [isotopic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy#Isotopy "Homotopy"): They are topologically equivalent, but their embeddings are not.

The [image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_(mathematics) "Image (mathematics)") of a continuous, [injective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(mathematics) "Injection (mathematics)") function from **R**<sup>2</sup> to higher-dimensional **R**<sup>n</sup> is said to be a [parametric surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_surface "Parametric surface"). Such an image is so-called because the _x_\- and _y_\- directions of the domain **R**<sup>2</sup> are 2 variables that parametrize the image. A parametric surface need not be a topological surface. A [surface of revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_of_revolution "Surface of revolution") can be viewed as a special kind of parametric surface.

If _f_ is a smooth function from **R**<sup>3</sup> to **R** whose [gradient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient "Gradient") is nowhere zero, then the [locus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_(mathematics) "Locus (mathematics)") of [zeros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_of_a_function "Root of a function") of _f_ does define a surface, known as an _[implicit surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit_surface "Implicit surface")_. If the condition of non-vanishing gradient is dropped, then the zero locus may develop singularities.

## Construction from polygons\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Surface_(topology)&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Construction from polygons")\]

Each closed surface can be constructed from an oriented polygon with an even number of sides, called a [fundamental polygon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_polygon "Fundamental polygon") of the surface, by pairwise identification of its edges. For example, in each polygon below, attaching the sides with matching labels (_A_ with _A_, _B_ with _B_), so that the arrows point in the same direction, yields the indicated surface.

-   [![sphere](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/SphereAsSquare.svg/120px-SphereAsSquare.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:SphereAsSquare.svg "sphere")
    
-   [![real projective plane](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/ProjectivePlaneAsSquare.svg/120px-ProjectivePlaneAsSquare.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:ProjectivePlaneAsSquare.svg "real projective plane")
    
-   [![torus](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/TorusAsSquare.svg/120px-TorusAsSquare.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:TorusAsSquare.svg "torus")
    
-   [![Klein bottle](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/KleinBottleAsSquare.svg/120px-KleinBottleAsSquare.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:KleinBottleAsSquare.svg "Klein bottle")
    

Any fundamental polygon can be written symbolically as follows. Begin at any vertex, and proceed around the perimeter of the polygon in either direction until returning to the starting vertex. During this traversal, record the label on each edge in order, with an exponent of -1 if the edge points opposite to the direction of traversal. The four models above, when traversed clockwise starting at the upper left, yield

Note that the sphere and the projective plane can both be realized as quotients of the 2-gon, while the torus and Klein bottle require a 4-gon (square).

The expression thus derived from a fundamental polygon of a surface turns out to be the sole relation in a [presentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation_of_a_group "Presentation of a group") of the [fundamental group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_group "Fundamental group") of the surface with the polygon edge labels as generators. This is a consequence of the [Seifert–van Kampen theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seifert%E2%80%93van_Kampen_theorem "Seifert–van Kampen theorem").

Gluing edges of polygons is a special kind of [quotient space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotient_space_(topology) "Quotient space (topology)") process. The quotient concept can be applied in greater generality to produce new or alternative constructions of surfaces. For example, the real projective plane can be obtained as the quotient of the sphere by identifying all pairs of opposite points on the sphere. Another example of a quotient is the connected sum.

## Connected sums\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Surface_(topology)&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Connected sums")\]

The [connected sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected_sum "Connected sum") of two surfaces _M_ and _N_, denoted _M_ # _N_, is obtained by removing a disk from each of them and gluing them along the boundary components that result. The boundary of a disk is a circle, so these boundary components are circles. The [Euler characteristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_characteristic "Euler characteristic") ![\chi ](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/656111758322ace96d80a9371771aa6d3de25437) of _M_ # _N_ is the sum of the Euler characteristics of the summands, minus two:

![{\displaystyle \chi (M{\mathbin {\#}}N)=\chi (M)+\chi (N)-2.\,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/59968edff384d3dd61cef1ab95f9796a93e86f6a)

The sphere **S** is an [identity element](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_element "Identity element") for the connected sum, meaning that **S** # _M_ = _M_. This is because deleting a disk from the sphere leaves a disk, which simply replaces the disk deleted from _M_ upon gluing.

Connected summation with the torus **T** is also described as attaching a "handle" to the other summand _M_. If _M_ is orientable, then so is **T** # _M_. The connected sum is associative, so the connected sum of a finite collection of surfaces is well-defined.

The connected sum of two real projective planes, **P** # **P**, is the [Klein bottle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klein_bottle "Klein bottle") **K**. The connected sum of the real projective plane and the Klein bottle is homeomorphic to the connected sum of the real projective plane with the torus; in a formula, **P** # **K** = **P** # **T**. Thus, the connected sum of three real projective planes is homeomorphic to the connected sum of the real projective plane with the torus. Any connected sum involving a real projective plane is nonorientable.

## Closed surfaces\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Surface_(topology)&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Closed surfaces")\]

"Open surface" redirects here. Not to be confused with [Free surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_surface "Free surface").

A **closed surface** is a surface that is [compact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space "Compact space") and without [boundary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_of_a_manifold "Boundary of a manifold"). Examples of closed surfaces include the [sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere "Sphere"), the [torus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torus "Torus") and the [Klein bottle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klein_bottle "Klein bottle"). Examples of non-closed surfaces include an [open disk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_(mathematics) "Disk (mathematics)") (which is a sphere with a [puncture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puncturing_(topology) "Puncturing (topology)")), a [cylinder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylinder_(geometry) "Cylinder (geometry)") (which is a sphere with two punctures), and the [Möbius strip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6bius_strip "Möbius strip").

A surface embedded in [three-dimensional space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional_space "Three-dimensional space") is closed if and only if it is the boundary of a solid. As with any [closed manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_manifold "Closed manifold"), a surface embedded in Euclidean space that is closed with respect to the inherited [Euclidean topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_topology "Euclidean topology") is _not_ necessarily a closed surface; for example, a disk embedded in ![ \mathbb{R}^3 ](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f936ddf584f8f3dd2a0ed08917001b7a404c10b5) that contains its boundary is a surface that is topologically closed but not a closed surface.

### Classification of closed surfaces\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Surface_(topology)&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Classification of closed surfaces")\]

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/SurfacesWithAndWithoutBoundary.svg/200px-SurfacesWithAndWithoutBoundary.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:SurfacesWithAndWithoutBoundary.svg)

Some examples of orientable closed surfaces (left) and surfaces with boundary (right). Left: Some orientable closed surfaces are the surface of a sphere, the surface of a [torus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torus "Torus"), and the surface of a cube. (The cube and the sphere are topologically equivalent to each other.) Right: Some surfaces with boundary are the [disk surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_(mathematics) "Disk (mathematics)"), square surface, and hemisphere surface. The boundaries are shown in red. All three of these are topologically equivalent to each other.

The _classification theorem of closed surfaces_ states that any [connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected_(topology) "Connected (topology)") closed surface is homeomorphic to some member of one of these three families:

1.  the [sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere "Sphere"),
2.  the [connected sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected_sum "Connected sum") of _g_ tori for _g_ ≥ 1,
3.  the [connected sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected_sum "Connected sum") of _k_ real [projective planes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_plane "Projective plane") for _k_ ≥ 1.

The surfaces in the first two families are [orientable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientability "Orientability"). It is convenient to combine the two families by regarding the sphere as the connected sum of 0 tori. The number _g_ of tori involved is called the _genus_ of the surface. The sphere and the torus have Euler characteristics 2 and 0, respectively, and in general the Euler characteristic of the connected sum of _g_ tori is 2 − 2_g_.

The surfaces in the third family are nonorientable. The Euler characteristic of the real projective plane is 1, and in general the Euler characteristic of the connected sum of _k_ of them is 2 − _k_.

It follows that a closed surface is determined, up to homeomorphism, by two pieces of information: its Euler characteristic, and whether it is orientable or not. In other words, Euler characteristic and orientability completely classify closed surfaces up to homeomorphism.

Closed surfaces with multiple [connected components](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected_component_(topology) "Connected component (topology)") are classified by the class of each of their connected components, and thus one generally assumes that the surface is connected.

### Monoid structure\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Surface_(topology)&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Monoid structure")\]

Relating this classification to connected sums, the closed surfaces up to homeomorphism form a [commutative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative "Commutative") [monoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoid "Monoid") under the operation of connected sum, as indeed do manifolds of any fixed dimension. The identity is the sphere, while the real projective plane and the torus generate this monoid, with a single relation **P** # **P** # **P** = **P** # **T**, which may also be written **P** # **K** = **P** # **T**, since **K** = **P** # **P**. This relation is sometimes known as **Dyck's theorem** after [Walther von Dyck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walther_von_Dyck "Walther von Dyck"), who proved it in ([Dyck 1888](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(topology)#CITEREFDyck1888)), and the triple cross surface **P** # **P** # **P** is accordingly called **Dyck's surface**.<sup id="cite_ref-fw_1-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(topology)#cite_note-fw-1">[1]</a></sup>

Geometrically, connect-sum with a torus (\# **T**) adds a handle with both ends attached to the same side of the surface, while connect-sum with a Klein bottle (\# **K**) adds a handle with the two ends attached to opposite sides of an orientable surface; in the presence of a projective plane (\# **P**), the surface is not orientable (there is no notion of side), so there is no difference between attaching a torus and attaching a Klein bottle, which explains the relation.

### Proof\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Surface_(topology)&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Proof")\]

The classification of closed surfaces has been known since the 1860s,<sup id="cite_ref-fw_1-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(topology)#cite_note-fw-1">[1]</a></sup> and today a number of proofs exist.

Topological and combinatorial proofs in general rely on the difficult result that every compact 2-manifold is homeomorphic to a [simplicial complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplicial_complex "Simplicial complex"), which is of interest in its own right. The most common proof of the classification is ([Seifert & Threlfall 1934](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(topology)#CITEREFSeifertThrelfall1934)),<sup id="cite_ref-fw_1-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(topology)#cite_note-fw-1">[1]</a></sup> which brings every triangulated surface to a standard form. A simplified proof, which avoids a standard form, was discovered by [John H. Conway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_H._Conway "John H. Conway") circa 1992, which he called the "Zero Irrelevancy Proof" or "ZIP proof" and is presented in ([Francis & Weeks 1999](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(topology)#CITEREFFrancisWeeks1999)).

A geometric proof, which yields a stronger geometric result, is the [uniformization theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniformization_theorem "Uniformization theorem"). This was originally proven only for Riemann surfaces in the 1880s and 1900s by [Felix Klein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Klein "Felix Klein"), [Paul Koebe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Koebe "Paul Koebe"), and [Henri Poincaré](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Poincar%C3%A9 "Henri Poincaré").

## Surfaces with boundary\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Surface_(topology)&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Surfaces with boundary")\]

[Compact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_manifold "Compact manifold") surfaces, possibly with boundary, are simply closed surfaces with a finite number of holes (open discs that have been removed). Thus, a connected compact surface is classified by the number of boundary components and the genus of the corresponding closed surface – equivalently, by the number of boundary components, the orientability, and Euler characteristic. The genus of a compact surface is defined as the genus of the corresponding closed surface.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (January 2020)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

This classification follows almost immediately from the classification of closed surfaces: removing an open disc from a closed surface yields a compact surface with a circle for boundary component, and removing _k_ open discs yields a compact surface with _k_ disjoint circles for boundary components. The precise locations of the holes are irrelevant, because the [homeomorphism group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeomorphism_group "Homeomorphism group") acts [_k_\-transitively](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitive_action "Transitive action") on any connected manifold of dimension at least 2.

Conversely, the boundary of a compact surface is a closed 1-manifold, and is therefore the disjoint union of a finite number of circles; filling these circles with disks (formally, taking the [cone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone_(topology) "Cone (topology)")) yields a closed surface.

The unique compact orientable surface of genus _g_ and with _k_ boundary components is often denoted ![\Sigma _{{g,k}},](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/99fbc84cddef11431ff3b26846013d097748ffd8) for example in the study of the [mapping class group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mapping_class_group "Mapping class group").

## Non-compact surfaces\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Surface_(topology)&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Non-compact surfaces")\]

Non-compact surfaces are more difficult to classify. As a simple example, a non-compact surface can be obtained by puncturing (removing a finite set of points from) a closed manifold. On the other hand, any open subset of a compact surface is itself a non-compact surface; consider, for example, the complement of a [Cantor set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor_set "Cantor set") in the sphere, otherwise known as the [Cantor tree surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor_tree_surface "Cantor tree surface"). However, not every non-compact surface is a subset of a compact surface; two canonical counterexamples are the [Jacob's ladder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob%27s_ladder_(manifold) "Jacob's ladder (manifold)") and the [Loch Ness monster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loch_Ness_monster_surface "Loch Ness monster surface"), which are non-compact surfaces with infinite genus.

A non-compact surface _M_ has a non-empty [space of ends](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_(topology) "End (topology)") _E_(_M_), which informally speaking describes the ways that the surface "goes off to infinity". The space _E_(_M_) is always topologically equivalent to a closed subspace of the [Cantor set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor_set "Cantor set"). _M_ may have a finite or countably infinite number N<sub>h</sub> of handles, as well as a finite or countably infinite number _N_<sub><i>p</i></sub> of [projective planes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_plane "Projective plane"). If both _N_<sub><i>h</i></sub> and _N_<sub><i>p</i></sub> are finite, then these two numbers, and the topological type of space of ends, classify the surface _M_ up to topological equivalence. If either or both of _N_<sub><i>h</i></sub> and _N_<sub><i>p</i></sub> is infinite, then the topological type of M depends not only on these two numbers but also on how the infinite one(s) approach the space of ends. In general the topological type of M is determined by the four subspaces of _E_(_M_) that are limit points of infinitely many handles and infinitely many projective planes, limit points of only handles, limit points of only projective planes, and limit points of neither.<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(topology)#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup>

## Assumption of second-countability\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Surface_(topology)&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Assumption of second-countability")\]

If one removes the assumption of second-countability from the definition of a surface, there exist (necessarily non-compact) topological surfaces having no countable base for their topology. Perhaps the simplest example is the Cartesian product of the [long line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_line_(topology) "Long line (topology)") with the space of real numbers.

Another surface having no countable base for its topology, but _not_ requiring the Axiom of Choice to prove its existence, is the [Prüfer manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pr%C3%BCfer_manifold "Prüfer manifold"), which can be described by simple equations that show it to be a [real-analytic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_analytic "Real analytic") surface. The Prüfer manifold may be thought of as the upper half plane together with one additional "tongue" _T_<sub><i>x</i></sub> hanging down from it directly below the point (_x_,0), for each real _x_.

In 1925, Tibor Radó proved that all Riemann surfaces (i.e., one-dimensional [complex manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_manifolds "Complex manifolds")) are necessarily second-countable ([Radó's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rad%C3%B3%27s_theorem_(Riemann_surfaces) "Radó's theorem (Riemann surfaces)")). By contrast, if one replaces the real numbers in the construction of the Prüfer surface by the complex numbers, one obtains a two-dimensional complex manifold (which is necessarily a 4-dimensional real manifold) with no countable base.

## Surfaces in geometry\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Surface_(topology)&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Surfaces in geometry")\]

[Polyhedra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyhedron "Polyhedron"), such as the boundary of a [cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cube "Cube"), are among the first surfaces encountered in geometry. It is also possible to define _smooth surfaces_, in which each point has a neighborhood [diffeomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffeomorphism "Diffeomorphism") to some open set in **E**<sup>2</sup>. This elaboration allows [calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus "Calculus") to be applied to surfaces to prove many results.

Two smooth surfaces are diffeomorphic if and only if they are homeomorphic. (The analogous result does not hold for higher-dimensional manifolds.) Thus [closed surfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(topology)#Closed_surface) are classified up to diffeomorphism by their Euler characteristic and orientability.

Smooth surfaces equipped with [Riemannian metrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannian_metric "Riemannian metric") are of foundational importance in [differential geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry "Differential geometry"). A Riemannian metric endows a surface with notions of [geodesic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic "Geodesic"), [distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance "Distance"), [angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle "Angle"), and area. It also gives rise to [Gaussian curvature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_curvature "Gaussian curvature"), which describes how curved or bent the surface is at each point. Curvature is a rigid, geometric property, in that it is not preserved by general diffeomorphisms of the surface. However, the famous [Gauss–Bonnet theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%E2%80%93Bonnet_theorem "Gauss–Bonnet theorem") for closed surfaces states that the integral of the Gaussian curvature _K_ over the entire surface _S_ is determined by the Euler characteristic:

![\int _{S}K\;dA=2\pi \chi (S).](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/881ff09ba9fede77ef26e379c57b039dbfeed492)

This result exemplifies the deep relationship between the geometry and topology of surfaces (and, to a lesser extent, higher-dimensional manifolds).

Another way in which surfaces arise in geometry is by passing into the complex domain. A complex one-manifold is a smooth oriented surface, also called a [Riemann surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_surface "Riemann surface"). Any complex nonsingular [algebraic curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_curve "Algebraic curve") viewed as a complex manifold is a Riemann surface. In fact, every compact orientable surface is realizable as a Riemann surface. Thus compact Riemann surfaces are characterized topologically by their genus: 0, 1, 2, .... On the other hand, the genus does not characterize the complex structure. For example, there are uncountably many non-isomorphic compact Riemann surfaces of genus 1 (the [elliptic curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve#Elliptic_curves_over_the_complex_numbers "Elliptic curve")).

Complex structures on a closed oriented surface correspond to [conformal equivalence classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformally_equivalent "Conformally equivalent") of Riemannian metrics on the surface. One version of the [uniformization theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniformization_theorem "Uniformization theorem") (due to [Poincaré](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Poincar%C3%A9 "Henri Poincaré")) states that any [Riemannian metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannian_metric "Riemannian metric") on an oriented, closed surface is conformally equivalent to an essentially unique metric of [constant curvature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_curvature "Constant curvature"). This provides a starting point for one of the approaches to [Teichmüller theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teichm%C3%BCller_theory "Teichmüller theory"), which provides a finer classification of Riemann surfaces than the topological one by Euler characteristic alone.

A _complex surface_ is a complex two-manifold and thus a real four-manifold; it is not a surface in the sense of this article. Neither are algebraic curves defined over [fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics) "Field (mathematics)") other than the complex numbers, nor are algebraic surfaces defined over [fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics) "Field (mathematics)") other than the real numbers.
