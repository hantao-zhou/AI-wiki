Axiomatic set theory is a branch of mathematical set theory that seeks to provide a rigorous foundation for mathematics by defining sets and their properties using a set of axioms (self-evident truths). The most commonly used axiomatic system for set theory is the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms (ZF), which was first proposed by Ernst Zermelo in 1908 and later refined by Abraham Fraenkel in 1922.

The ZF axioms define sets as collections of objects that satisfy certain properties, such as the extensionality axiom, which states that two sets are equal if and only if they have the same elements. The axioms also establish the existence of various types of sets, such as the empty set, the power set, and the ordinal numbers, and define operations on sets, such as union, intersection, and complement.

One of the key features of axiomatic set theory is that it allows for the construction of new sets and the derivation of new theorems from the axioms. For example, the axiom of choice, which states that given any collection of non-empty sets, there exists a way to choose one element from each set, is a powerful tool for constructing new sets and proving mathematical theorems.

Axiomatic set theory has been used to develop many branches of mathematics, including algebra, topology, and analysis. It has also been used as a foundation for computer science, particularly in the areas of programming languages and formal verification.

However, axiomatic set theory is not without its controversies and limitations. One of the most famous paradoxes in set theory is the Russell's paradox, which shows that the naive set theory (the theory that sets can be defined without any axioms) leads to contradictions. In response, axiomatic set theory was developed in order to overcome these paradoxes, but new paradoxes have emerged, such as the Banach-Tarski paradox. Despite these challenges, axiomatic set theory remains a foundational tool in modern mathematics and continues to be an active area of research.
