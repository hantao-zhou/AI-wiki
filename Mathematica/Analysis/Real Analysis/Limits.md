# Limits Theory in Mathematics

From the [README] you 

Limits theory is a fundamental concept in mathematics, particularly in calculus and real analysis. A limit is the value that a function approaches as the input approaches a certain value. Here are some key points to keep in mind when studying limits theory:

- Definition: A limit is a concept that describes the behavior of a function as the input approaches a certain value. Specifically, a limit L exists as x approaches a if and only if for every ε > 0, there exists a δ > 0 such that |f(x) - L| < ε whenever 0 < |x - a| < δ.

- Notation: The notation used to denote a limit is lim f(x) = L as x approaches a. Alternatively, one may write f(x) -> L as x -> a.

- One-sided limits: A function may have different limits as the input approaches a from the left or the right. The left limit is denoted as lim f(x) as x approaches a- and the right limit is denoted as lim f(x) as x approaches a+.

- Infinite limits: A function may approach infinity or negative infinity as the input approaches a. This is denoted as lim f(x) = ∞ or lim f(x) = -∞.

- Properties of limits: Limits satisfy certain properties, such as the limit of a sum is the sum of the limits and the limit of a product is the product of the limits.

- Intermediate value theorem: The intermediate value theorem states that if a function f is continuous on the closed interval [a, b] and if k is any number between f(a) and f(b), then there exists a number c in the open interval (a, b) such that f(c) = k.

- L'Hopital's rule: L'Hopital's rule is a technique for evaluating limits of indeterminate forms, such as 0/0 or infinity/infinity. It states that if lim f(x)/g(x) = 0/0 or infinity/infinity, then lim f(x)/g(x) = lim f'(x)/g'(x).

By understanding these key points, you can gain a deeper appreciation for the importance of limits theory in mathematics and how it can be applied to solve real-world problems.
