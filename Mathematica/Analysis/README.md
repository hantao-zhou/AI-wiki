# Key Points for Mathematical Analysis

Mathematical analysis is the study of the properties and behavior of functions, sequences, and series. It is divided into two categories: real analysis and complex analysis. Here are some key points to keep in mind when studying mathematical analysis:

- Real Analysis: Deals with the study of real-valued functions, sequences, and series. It includes concepts such as limits, continuity, differentiation, integration, and convergence.

- Complex Analysis: Deals with the study of functions of a complex variable. It includes concepts such as analytic functions, Cauchy's theorem, Laurent series, and residues.

- Convergence: Refers to the behavior of a sequence or series as the number of terms approaches infinity. Convergence can be absolute, conditional, or uniform.

- Continuity: A function is continuous if it preserves limits, that is, if the limit of the function equals the function of the limit.

- Differentiation: Refers to the process of finding the derivative of a function. The derivative measures the rate of change of a function at a particular point.

- Integration: Refers to the process of finding the integral of a function. The integral measures the area under the curve of the function.

- Taylor Series: A series expansion of a function about a particular point, expressed as an infinite sum of terms involving the function's derivatives at that point.

- Fourier Series: A series expansion of a periodic function in terms of trigonometric functions, used to analyze the function's frequency content.

- Functional Analysis: A branch of analysis that studies functions as objects in their own right. It includes concepts such as Banach spaces, Hilbert spaces, and linear operators.

By understanding these key points, you can gain a deeper appreciation for the beauty and complexity of mathematical analysis and how it can be applied to solve real-world problems.

# init script

Here is an example shell script that creates folders for each key point listed in the previous answer:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Create array of key points
key_points=("Real Analysis" "Complex Analysis" "Convergence" "Continuity" "Differentiation" "Integration" "Taylor Series" "Fourier Series" "Functional Analysis")

# Loop through array and create a folder for each key point
for key_point in "${key_points[@]}"
do
    mkdir "$key_point"
done
```

This script creates a new directory for each key point in the current working directory. You can modify the array of key points to include your own list of topics, and change the `mkdir` command to specify a different path for the new directories if desired.
