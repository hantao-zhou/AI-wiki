# intro

Flan stands for "Finetuned Language Model for Answering Natural language questions", and it is based on the PaLM, T5, and U-PaLM models. The authors show that Flan outperforms baseline T5 models by a large margin and achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks. They also publicly release Flan-T5 models for others to use and build upon.
